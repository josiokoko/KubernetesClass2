Data storage challenges:
    - Sharing of data by containers in a Pod 
    - Sharing of data by Pods
    - Persisting data beyond life-cycle of a Pod 

Tasks:
    - Need to find a way to share the storage among different containers in the same pod


VOLUMES:
    (1) Ephemeral VOLUMES:    
        - volume lifetime is the same as that of the pod that uses it
        - if a container restarts, the same Volume will be used by the new container 
        - once a pod terminates or is restarted, the Volume ceases to exist
    (2) Persistent Volumes: 
        - PV solves the problem associated with Volumes


How to Use Volume:

    (1) .spec.volumes field defines the Volumes this pod is planning to use
    (2) .spec.containers.volumeMounts defines where to mount those Volumes in individual containers


Types of Volumes:
    - k8s supports several types of volumes 
    - availability often depends on your cloud provider 
    - AWS, GCP, Azure and etc. support different types of volumes 
    - Common types of Volumes:
        (1) EmptyDir:
            - An empty directory that's created when a pod is assigned to a node
            - Only exists as long as the pod does
            - Containers in a pod can write and read files from this directory
            - Same emptyDir Volume can be mounted on different paths for different containers 

        (2) Hostpath:
            - Used to mount a file or a directory from the host node's filesystem to a pod
