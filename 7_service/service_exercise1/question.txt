Description:
    The queue used by Fleetman vehicles to report their positions.
    Implement as a simple ActiveMQ endpoint

    Docker Image:
        richardchesterwood/k8s-fleetman-queue:release1 

    Port 8161 is the admin console (admin/admin as user/password combination)
    Expose this to a browser using port 30010


Solution
    To run: 
        docker container run -d --network fleetman -p 8161:8161 richardchesterwood/k8s-fleetman-queue:release1
    
    The port mapping is only neccessary if you want to peek at the queue. 
    It is not secure (user/pass ==> admin/admin)
